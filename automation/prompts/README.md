# Translation Prompt Templates

The files in this directory provide templates and guidance for translation prompts, enabling consistent terminology across locales and services.

## Files

- `llm_translation_prompt.txt` — Base prompt for LLM-based translation (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI).
- `glossary.json` — Example glossary structure for enforcing preferred terms.

Adjust these assets to match your brand voice and terminology, then reference them from the n8n workflow before sending content to the translation provider.
