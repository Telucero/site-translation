# Documentation Demo

Welcome to the multilingual demo site used to prototype the documentation translation workflow. The English content underpins the automated localization pipeline that runs after pull requests merge into the default branch.

## What You Can Do Here

- Explore a sample information architecture similar to the production site.
- Run `mkdocs serve` to view the English source content alongside localized builds.
- Trigger the GitHub Action workflow to send page updates to n8n for translation.
- Inspect the returned translations to confirm terminology and glossary settings in n8n.

!!! tip "Try the language selector"
    Use the dropdown in the footer to navigate between English, Spanish, and French test translations generated by the automation pipeline.

## How the Demo Works

1. Author updates land in `docs/en/`.
2. GitHub Actions detects merged changes and pushes the diff to n8n.
3. n8n translates the content and commits localized Markdown files under `docs/<lang>/`.
4. MkDocs rebuilds the static site, producing `/en/`, `/es/`, and `/fr/` language variants.

See the [Translation Workflow](guides/translation-flow.md) guide for implementation details.
